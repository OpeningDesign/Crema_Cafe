For the test images:
The counters are exactly in the same place as before, but the one with POS is 2 feet longer than the old one, so people can walk from kitchen and serve people at same time. It also has a 6" display in front of it.
The logos are stickers.
The wooden boxes give some decor.
I've tried to change the ambiance with few changes.

I'm uploading a new set of images with the corrections. The only change I made is to use a backlight as signage on the top shelf.
The moon sticker is on an acrylic board.
