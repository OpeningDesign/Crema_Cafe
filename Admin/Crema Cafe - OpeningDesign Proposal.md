Hi Steven, thanks for the followup meeting the other day.  Per our conversation, I've adjusted the scope below. 

Although a more nuanced list of requirements will undoubtedly unfold as the project evolves, on a high-level, I understand that the project will include the following list of requirements/priorities...

- In general, looking to renovate the POS area.
	- A more efficient flow between front-of-house POS and the kitchen
	- New layout should facilitate grab-and-go business better, without interrupting dining room experience.
		- 2 POS stations, one for grab and go, the other for dining.
	- More customer display and/or storage area...
		- Refrigerated
		- and Merchandise display.  Perhaps shelves in front of POS counter.
			- Potentially remove existing cabinets
	- More employee storage behind counter
	- Expresso station to remain.
	- More consolidated areas for customer, as well. Prevent employees crossing over one another. 
		- Water supply station.
		- Coffee area...
			- Potentially tiering the coffee carafes
		- Condiments, etc. 
	- Free up wall space.  More storage.  Possibly display bulk goods.
		- Teas
		- coffee
		- etc.
	- Hanging signage.
- Consolidated baking station in the back - not in scope. 
- Improve efficiency of prep area near POS
	- Possible ice machine
	- possible ice bin
	- Dry storage
- Dishwasher area to stay in current location
- A few aesthetic keywords/phrases that were discussed...
	- Bright colors
	- Wood grains
		- lighter oak stains.
	- Clever use of plywood
	- California ranch feel
	- Spanning Logo
	- 50's ranch
	- exposed concrete floors
- Design with 2nd phase in mind. 
- Preliminary construction budget to be between $20,000 - $30,000



The above list is located here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17MUyWKnUarxvMz-zBbirFuwP_Qig4HNZhE4SCI3wKlw/edit
This will be a living document throughout the project, please feel free to modify, reorder and/or add to the list as you see fit. It works like a 'word processor' in your browser where anyone can type in real time.

## Hourly Rates Relative to Workflow	

Over the years, OpeningDesign has developed a preferred and unique way of working.  Although our website's [about page](http://openingdesign.com/about/) provides more detail, in a nutshell, most of our projects are [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and are conducted [out-in-the-open](http://openingdesign.com/about/).

Simply put, this way of working allows OpeningDesign and our extended team of consultants, to be more efficient--ultimately keeping costs down and bringing more value to our clients.  Having said that, we understand some clients, for whatever reason, may have hesitations regarding this approach.

To address your potential concerns, if any, we would like to offer the following (3) workflow and fee options:

 * **Approach (A): A Fully Open Approach** where the construction documentation, location, and the names of the parties involved in this contract are known and are shared publicly.  All of OpeningDesign's (and their consultant's) newly created documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  That is, will be freely available to any party for future use, assuming the terms such as [Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and [ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) are honored.
	 * We used this approach for a Sport Complex in Jefferson, WI, the files (CAD/BIM) of which can be found [here](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/Sports_Complex) and a log of communication that happened between the design team and general contractor, [here](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/Sports_Complex/issues?q=is:issue+is:closed+sort:comments-desc).
 * **Approach (B): An Anonymous Open Approach** where all newly created documentation is shared publicly, however, the project location and the names of the direct or indirect clients, are kept anonymous.   Again, similar to approach (A), all of OpeningDesign's (and their consultant's) newly created digital documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
	 * We used this approach on an office/warehouse facility here in southern Wisconsin, of which the (CAD/BIM) files can be found [here](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/Open_Source_Metal_Building).
 * **Approach &#40;C): The Traditional Approach** where all documentation, and clients involved, remains confidential and private.   Per industry norm, the Architect and the Architectâ€™s consultants are deemed the authors and owners of their respective Instruments of Service, and they retain all common law and statutory rights, including copyright.

> Please note, these are not **lump sum** fees, but are instead, **not-to-exceed** fees.  If the project costs go down/up, or less/more scope is involved over time, these fee ceilings will adjust relatively. 
> 
> The **Hourly Rates**, called out below, will apply until this not-to-exceed fee is reached.

>By using hourly rates and a not-to-exceed fees based on percentages of construction, we have found this to be a win-win for both parties.  The design professionals are given a little more safeguard against potential [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) and the client can realize more economical fees if they are able to make decisions quicker and more consistently--moving the design of the project along quicker.  In addition, clients are able to adjust, on the fly, what types of services they might or might not need as the project unfolds.

### The Determination of the Not-to-Exceed Fee

For your reference and peace of mind, please review the following document as to what the standard practices are for establishing design fees in the construction/architecture industry.

[A Guide Determining Appropriate Fees for the Services of an Architect](http://www.mbarchitects.org/docs/guide_architectservicefees%28e%29.pdf)
